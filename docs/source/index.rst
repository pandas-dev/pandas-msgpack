Welcome to pandas-msgpack's documentation!
==========================================

The :mod:`pandas_msgpack` module provides an interface from `pandas https://pandas.pydata.org`
to the `msgpack <http://msgpack.org/index.html>`__ library. This is a lightweight portable
binary format, similar to binary JSON, that is highly space efficient, and provides good performance
both on the writing (serialization), and reading (deserialization).
